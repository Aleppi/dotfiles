# My dotfiles

## Installation

I use `yadm` for managing my dotfiles, so to install just do `yadm clone
https://github.com/Aleppi/dotfiles.git`. The bootstrap program may not work
properly at the moment. I use my own patched version of dmenu, which can be
found at [Aleppi/dmenu-patched](https://github.com/Aleppi/dmenu-patched).

## List of dependecies
* bspwm
* sxhkd
* polybar (compiled with mpd, alsa, github and network modules enabled)
* zsh
* Terminus (as well as the powerline patched version)
* Unifont
* Siji icons
* urxvt
* neovim
* ranger
* mpd
* ncmpcpp
* wal
* dunst
* dmenu
* oomox

## Current issues
Dunst hasn't been properly configured yet.
