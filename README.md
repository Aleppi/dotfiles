# My dotfiles

## Installation

I use `yadm` for managing my dotfiles, so to install just do `yadm clone
https://github.com/Aleppi/dotfiles.git`. The bootstrap program may not work
properly at the moment. I use my own patched version of dmenu, which can be
found at [Aleppi/dmenu-patched](https://github.com/Aleppi/dmenu-patched).
